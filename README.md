## Improvements and Additions 💹:


### Open issues 🔴:

Issues are open in the issues section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic Improvements :

1. When updates occurs to the database whole list is reloaded with content for example everytime a new songs loads
2. Initiate the apis and services during the splash screen 👷‍ - 4
3. Implement MVVM and seperate UI and business logics from activities and fragments 👷‍♀️ - L
3. Use dependency injections like dagger2 for more flexibility 👷‍♀️ - L

### Database and Backend Related :

1. Fetch only nodes which are updated , not the whole base.
2. Used Spotify api to extract details from the trackIDs instead of whole details of the track , so that less data is fetched , therefore faster embedding.
3. Do network stuff async ✅

-----------

### UX/UI Improvements :

1. Speak human, easy to understand..layman's.
2. Change equilizer size  ✅
3. Show rotating of discs only to the songs which users plays of the friends fragment
4. Make bottom navigation hidable when scrolled down
5. Make figma models of the screens and then design the app accordingly 👷‍
